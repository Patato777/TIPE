# TIPE

The repositorie containing my programs for my MP* TIPE.

Topic: "How to optimize the composition of the pools during a tournament, given their size, in order to reduce the total travel distance"

Programs: 
  - graph.py: basic module to implement complete weighted graphs and create random ones
  - Considered solutions:
    - kmeans.py: classical kmeans, with slight modifications in order to create cluster of given cardinal (early: early version, legacy; new: current version)
    - genetic.py: classical genetic algorithm
    - eucl dive.py: Euclidean diving of a graph, cartesian coordinates are associated with each edge
    - post_permut.py: 2-opt algorithm but not quite
